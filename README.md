# Cplusplusprogram
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving: this program is to track animal data. 
What did you do particularly well? Organizing data and user interface.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 
I definitely need to organize my code better and work on presentation of the program. 
Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Yes the program was really challenging to me and I have to spend hours doing research. I mostly use google and join some online forum to help answer some of the question I have for this program.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skills that I think can transfer to other project is the creating class.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I try to make it as short as possible and easy to understand. Put a lot of comment in there so I would understand what I was doing in the future when I look back at it.
